# Alien-invasion

Some background about the game 
The game inspiration comes from star wars clone wars  Space Battle of Kamino
Let's start from the beginning and look at the context. Since this is where all of the games will take place,
I thought I  should make it nice and easy to keep the player from being distracted.
I'll render a starry backdrop to represent Earth's defense against an alien invasion from space.

Cannons

In the game I am  building,
The player controls a cannon at the bottom of the screen, shooting up at the advancing aliens, earning points and saving the day. 
To start building our cannon user will first need to click on the Paint New Sprite icon, 
highlighted in the image below. 
It’s this option that will allow me  to design all the elements of our game, including the cannon that we’ll draw now. 

Since the screen is now available it will have  a  set of instructions for the cannon so user  can control it from within the game. 

Laser

I set up our laser that the user will use to  shoot from the cannon at the aliens. 
Just like previous scenarios I will need to select the Paint New Sprite icon and draw our simple laser beam as shown below. 

The aliens

Since the game now has something to shoot but nothing to shoot at.
Alien Invasion game  is all about attacking aliens so i will  draw the  first one using a  Paint New Sprite icon. 

Game over 
Like with any game, the user  can’t win every time so we need to have a think about what happens when it’s game over. 
For this  game, everything finishes when an alien reaches the bottom of the screen and collides into our cannon.


Adding more aliens

To save us time and effort building each additional alien from the very beginning 
i   copy the first one i  made, copy it over and over until we have a large alien army. 
Not only does the sprite get copied but all its blocks do too. 
For each alien that I copy There was an need to add in a new starting coordinate.
Otherwise all the aliens will start on top of each other.
I did  this by changing the starting coordinates of certain blocks.

Scoring
Inorder to make things interesting and start keeping score of how many aliens we shoot.
I  did  this by using a variable.Imaging this  variable as a piece of paper. 
Every time user  shoots  an alien a new score is written on the paper, recording it until we need to increase it. 
To add a new variable, I  createed a  Data section, 
that will enable me to make a new variable called ‘Score’ and set it for all sprites.
I  instruct the computer to increase our score every time a user shoots an alien 
and I do this in the blocks of every alien sprite we’re created.


Am glad I finished it!Though some improvements can be done.
